        <h3>Here's a timeline of Anakin's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>41 BBY</strong> - Skywalker was born on the desert planet of
            Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories. He was the son of Shmi
            Skywalker, a slave who conceived a child without a father. His blood
            contained over twenty-thousand midi-chlorians, surpassing that of
            Grand Master Yoda and all other Jedi in the galaxy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>32 BBY</strong> - Following the Battle of Naboo, the Jedi
            High Council admitted Skywalker into the Order as the Padawan of
            Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi despite feeling that he was too old and
            emotional to adhere to the Jedi Code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>22 BBY</strong> - The start of the Clone Wars. Anakin falls
            in love with Padame (which defies the Jedi-code) he actively
            particpates in the war and struggles with himself to remain Obi-Wan
            Kenobi's apprentice. He single-handedly duels a Sith Lord by the
            name of Count Dooku and gets his hand sliced off in the process.
            Subsequently his hand is replaced with a mechanical one which
            foreshadows his complete cyborg reconstruction in the near future.
            He also finds out that his mother was murdered by Tusken Raiders at
            the end and retaliates by killing their entire tribe which
            introduces us to his Dark-side.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>19 BBY</strong> - Skywalker has a second duel with Dooku and
            is coxed on by Emperor Palpatine to execute him which he does - this
            is against the Jedi-way which forshadows his apprenticeship under
            him. Skywalker's faith in the Jedi High Council begins to shake when
            they refuse to make him a Jedi master after this victory. He later
            learns that Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine is Darth Sidious, the
            elusive Dark Lord of the Sith who orchestrated the Clone war in
            order to take over the galaxy. Manipulated into believing that the
            Jedi had failed him and coupled with his fear of losing Amidala in
            childbirth, Skywalker betrays and turns against the Jedi Order,
            believing Sidious had the knowledge to cheat death. Consumed by the
            persona of Darth Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marches his legion on
            the Jedi Temple of Coruscant where they executed its inhabitants,
            including Jedi younglings, as part of Order 66 and the Great Jedi
            Purge. Vader was then sent to Mustafar to exterminate the Separatist
            Council at the behest of his Sith Master, who became the
            self-proclaimed Galactic Emperor. Vader subsequently sustained
            severe injuries in his duel with Kenobi, and was rebuilt as an
            armored cyborg while his wife died of a broken heart.
