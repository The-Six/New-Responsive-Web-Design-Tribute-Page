        <h3>Here's a timeline of Anakin's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>41 BBY</strong> - Skywalker was born on the desert planet of Tatooine in the
            Outer Rim Territories. He was the son of Shmi Skywalker, a slave who
            conceived a child without a father. His blood contained over
            twenty-thousand midi-chlorians, surpassing that of Grand Master Yoda
            and all other Jedi in the galaxy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>32 BBY</strong> - Following the Battle of Naboo, the Jedi High Council
            admitted Skywalker into the Order as the Padawan of Jedi Knight
            Obi-Wan Kenobi despite feeling that he was too old and emotional to
            adhere to the Jedi Code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>22 BBY</strong> - The start of the Clone Wars. Anakin falls in love with
            Padame (which defies the Jedi-code) he actively particpates in the
            war and struggles with himself to remain Obi-Wan Kenobi's
            apprentice. He single-handedly duels a Sith Lord by the name of
            Count Doku and gets his hand sliced off in the process. He also
            finds out that his mother was murdered by Tusken Raiders at the end
            and retaliates by killing their entire tribe which introduces us to
            his Dark-side.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>19 BBY</strong> - Skywalker's faith in the Jedi High Council begins to shake when
            Tano left the Jedi Order in 19 BBY, Skywalker learns that Supreme
            Chancellor Sheev Palpatine is Darth Sidious, the elusive Dark Lord
            of the Sith who orchestrated the Clone war in order to take over the
            galaxy. Manipulated into believing that the Jedi had failed him and
            coupled with his fear of losing Amidala in childbirth, Skywalker
            betrays and turns against the Jedi Order, believing Sidious had
            the knowledge to cheat death. Consumed by the persona of Darth
            Vader, the fallen Jedi Knight marches his legion on the Jedi Temple
            of Coruscant where they executed its inhabitants, including Jedi
            younglings, as part of Order 66 and the Great Jedi Purge. Vader was
            then sent to Mustafar to exterminate the Separatist Council at the
            behest of his Sith Master, who became the self-proclaimed Galactic
            Emperor. Vader subsequently sustained severe injuries in his duel
            with Kenobi, and was rebuilt as an armored cyborg while his wife
            died of a broken heart.
