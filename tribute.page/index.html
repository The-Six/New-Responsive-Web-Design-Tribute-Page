        <h3>Here's a timeline of Anakin's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            41 BBY - Skywalker was born on the desert planet of Tatooine in the
            Outer Rim Territories. He was the son of Shmi Skywalker, a slave who
            conceived a child without a father. His blood contained over
            twenty-thousand midi-chlorians, surpassing that of Grand Master Yoda
            and all other Jedi in the galaxy.
          </li>
          <li>
            32 BBY - Following the Battle of Naboo, the Jedi High Council
            admitted Skywalker into the Order as the Padawan of Jedi Knight
            Obi-Wan Kenobi despite feeling that he was too old and emotional to
            adhere to the Jedi Code.
          </li>
          <li>
            22 BBY - The start of the Clone Wars. Anakin falls in love with
            Padame (which defies the Jedi-code) he actively particpates in the
            war and struggles with himself to remain Obi-Wan Kenobi's
            apprentice. He single-handedly duels a Sith Lord by the name of
            Count Doku and gets his hand sliced off in the process. He also
            finds out that his mother was murdered by Tusken Raiders at the end
            and retaliates by killing their entire tribe which introduces us to
            his Dark-side.
